0.0.0.0/0,10.0.0.10,1433,ICMP,N/A,This rule allows access to or from the entire public internet (0.0.0.0/0), which is highly permissive and should be used with caution. Ensure this exposure is intentional, restricted by additional controls (e.g., authentication, IP whitelisting, segmentation), and regularly reviewed. Consider narrowing the scope to known IP ranges when possible to reduce attack surface.,Block this rule,High Risk,85
